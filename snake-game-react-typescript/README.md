# Snake Game (React + TypeScript)

This project is a classic Snake game implemented using React and TypeScript.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the game running quickly:

Make sure you are in the `snake-game-react-typescript` directory before running these commands.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the game:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the game in your default web browser, usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can also run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
